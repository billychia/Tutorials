concepts that might help solve this problem:

find a place where the instruction intersects with the address (for example putting instruction 9 at address 9 or some variant)

Can this be done with r0 only or do you need r1? 

8 and 9 seem to be key and they are the flow control 

swapping seems like it could be a powerful way to affect the program - but those values are high - 14 & 15. Do I need to create a progam that loops, modifies itself on the second run and then terminates? 

12 & 13 store r0/r1 into a cell, as powerful as swapping in the ability to mutate the program, but able to do so earlier. 

a mutating program is an interesting concept

If it mutates - what should it print out - the original or the final code? 

If I use r1, then 4 and 5 seem like they could provide something interesting. 

In some way you have to get the program to 7 then 0 

Maybe it's simpler than I think and there's a non-mutating way to simply loop and print. 

hmm... while playing I stubled accross perhaps a busy beaver answer - 1 3 5 7 8
prints out

2 5 9 1 4 4 1 1 3 1 2 6 1 1 3 1 0 8 7 7 8 1 0 1 3 1 6 1 2 3 1 1 4 1 4 9 5 2 0

3 5 7 8 prints:

1 5 
1 3 
1 0 
6 
1 
1 1 
4 
1 2 
3

addinga  few more 7's gives you:

2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 8 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 1 4 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0


busy beaver - if it's zero, add 2? maybe - how do you get it to terminate? 

This got me 352:

4 5 7 8

9 13 14 15
9 0 0 0

4 5 7 7 7 8 0 14 15 2 9 14 15 9 0 0

3 5 7 8 0 14 15 1 3 9 15 14 15 9 0 0
